Creating apps in R shiny with different functionality

## The Trashketball App 
My first shiny app: Collects user scores, calculates points and stores data in google sheets. A children's game to learn terms used in Data Science: Data Collection, Data Sets and Tables as part of a Data Curiosity program for children aged 12-16

### Functionality
User Interface - User enters their name, number of shots they made into trash can within a 1 meter( 3 feet range) and number of shots they made at approx 2m (5 -6 feet range)

On Submit - Server calculates the points earned by user as (2 * shots made at 1 meter) + (3 * shots made at 2m)

Output - Number of points earned and a link to the collected dataset of all users on google sheets.

## The Mining Stock Data app
This is a UDEMY course project app which displays and calculates the valuation of a mining company based on the calculated score of its stocks (plots of land owned : Graded 1 to 3 based on level of minerals found in plot).
This score is weighted differently by different companies.

ðŸŽ¯ Using sliders, you can adjust weights and produce different calculated scores/valuations for each company visualized in the scatter chart.

ðŸŽ¯ You can select points on the chart to view a table selection of interesting points (companies of interest).

ðŸŽ¯ You can then download the selected data to csv.

ðŸŽ¯ You can view the original data in a separate tab

### Functionality

ðŸŽ¯ Using sliders you can slect the age of mother and the years of interest for all existing data on mothers aged 15-19 from 1980 -2022

ðŸŽ¯ The second tab looks at a comparison between time series of early births 2018-2022 and enrollment drop rates 2018-2022

ðŸŽ¯ The third tab looks at the static correlation between the two variables

ðŸŽ¯ The aggregated data from 2018-2022 can be viewed and downloaded as csv.
